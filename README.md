## About
This code was generated by [CodeCraftAI](https://codecraft.name)

**User requests:**
I want you to build me an app for buying premium NFTs. I want user to pay me 100 CRAFT (of course, user has to sign transaction). That transaction and user ownership of certain NFT should be stored somewhere. CRAFT is a Solana-based token btw. Once paid, user has to get access to that NFT in form of web, mail and image. For NFTs, generate some nice svg images.

## Project Plan
```
Okay, that's a great clarification!  I'm assuming the role of project manager here, and based on your detailed information, I will create a simple and clear project plan.

**Project: NFT Marketplace (CRAFT Token)**

**Goal:** Develop a web application for selling premium NFTs, accepting CRAFT tokens as payment, and delivering NFTs in various formats.

**Project Phases:**

1.  **Planning & Setup (1 Week)**
2.  **Backend Development (3 Weeks)**
3.  **Frontend Development (3 Weeks)**
4.  **Integration & Testing (2 Weeks)**
5.  **Deployment & Documentation (1 Week)**

**Phase 1: Planning & Setup (1 Week)**

*   **Tasks:**
    *   1.1 Define project scope and finalize requirements (Based on the details clarified).
    *   1.2 Set up project repositories (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
    *   1.3 Environment setup (development, testing, production environments)
    *   1.4 Database Selection (PostgreSQL, MySQL or NoSQL (e.g. MongoDB) depending on the choice of storing transactions)
    *   1.5 Define API endpoints between Frontend and Backend.
    *   1.6 Setup basic project structure (folders, files).
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Project plan document.
    *   Repository initialized.
    *   Development environments configured.
    *   API endpoint list
    *   Chosen database.
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   Choosing the right database based on the expected data volume, query patterns, and scalability requirements.
    *   Setting up secure and isolated environments.
    *   Selecting appropriate development tools and libraries.
    *   Ensure Solana DevNet is enabled and account keys are configured correctly.
    *   Confirm the exact token details (mint address, decimals, etc.) and smart contract interactions (if applicable).

**Phase 2: Backend Development (3 Weeks)**

*   **Tasks:**
    *   2.1 Design database schema for NFTs, transactions, and user ownership.
    *   2.2 Implement API endpoints for:
        *   NFT retrieval.
        *   Payment processing (Solana CRAFT transaction).
        *   Transaction history.
        *   User authentication (registration, login).
    *   2.3 Implement NFT generation logic (using SVG generation library).
    *   2.4 Implement email sending functionality.
    *   2.5 Unit testing.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Functional REST API.
    *   Database schema.
    *   NFT generation module.
    *   Email sending module.
    *   Unit tests.
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   Solana integration using a suitable Python library (e.g., `solders`, `solana`.py).
    *   Secure handling of private keys and API keys for email service.
    *   Efficient NFT generation algorithm to ensure uniqueness and avoid performance bottlenecks.
    *   Error handling and logging.
    *   Database connection pooling and optimization.
    *   Rate Limiting API endpoints.
    *   Implement transaction verification mechanisms. Double check if the correct amount of token was send to the correct address.

**Phase 3: Frontend Development (3 Weeks)**

*   **Tasks:**
    *   3.1 Develop user interface using React.
    *   3.2 Implement user authentication (login, registration).
    *   3.3 Integrate with Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare).
    *   3.4 Implement NFT browsing and purchase functionality.
    *   3.5 Display transaction history.
    *   3.6 Implement NFT display in web format.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Interactive user interface.
    *   Solana wallet integration.
    *   Functional NFT purchase flow.
    *   Transaction history display.
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   React component library selection (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design).
    *   Solana wallet adapter libraries (e.g., `@solana/wallet-adapter-*`).
    *   Secure storage of user authentication tokens.
    *   Responsive design for different screen sizes.
    *   Consider accessibility.

**Phase 4: Integration & Testing (2 Weeks)**

*   **Tasks:**
    *   4.1 Integrate frontend and backend.
    *   4.2 End-to-end testing (user flows).
    *   4.3 Security testing.
    *   4.4 Performance testing.
    *   4.5 Bug fixing.
    *   4.6 User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Fully integrated application.
    *   Test reports.
    *   List of resolved bugs.
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   API testing tools (e.g., Postman, Insomnia).
    *   Security vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   Performance monitoring tools.

**Phase 5: Deployment & Documentation (1 Week)**

*   **Tasks:**
    *   5.1 Deploy backend to a server (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
    *   5.2 Deploy frontend to a hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
    *   5.3 Configure CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
    *   5.4 Create user documentation.
    *   5.5 Create API documentation.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   Deployed application.
    *   CI/CD pipelines.
    *   User documentation.
    *   API documentation.
*   **Technical Considerations:**
    *   Server configuration and security hardening.
    *   DNS configuration.
    *   SSL certificate management.

**Dependencies & Tools:**

*   **Frontend:** React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Solana Wallet Adapter libraries, Component Library (e.g. Material UI).
*   **Backend:** Python, Flask/FastAPI (web framework), Solana Python library, Database library (e.g. Psycopg2 for PostgreSQL), Email library, SVG generation library.
*   **Blockchain:** Solana, CRAFT Token (Requires Token Mint Address).
*   **Development & Deployment:** Git, Docker, CI/CD tools.

**Communication:**

*   Daily stand-up meetings.
*   Weekly progress reports.
*   Issue tracking (Jira, Trello, etc.).

**Risks & Mitigation:**

*   **Solana Integration Issues:** Thorough testing and integration with Solana testnet before going live.
*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Regular security audits and penetration testing.
*   **Performance Bottlenecks:** Load testing and performance optimization.

**Open Questions (from previous clarification):**

*   **NFT Uniqueness Algorithm:**  We need details on how uniqueness is enforced.
*   **NFT Metadata:** What fields (besides the image) should be included?
*   **Payment Wallet:**  The Solana wallet address to receive CRAFT.
*   **Delivery Method (Web):** How do you want users to access the NFT on the web.
*   **Error Handling**: What to do if the payment fails.

This detailed project plan provides a solid framework for developing the proposed NFT marketplace. Remember that these project plans are high-level, and can vary based on team size, budget and other restrictions.
